Exploring the hardware architecture and harvesting sensors from a Microsoft Optical Mouse for AI robotics integration
Project: As an AI Engineer and Computer Science student, I am exploring the intersection of hardware and software. This project involves the systematic teardown and reverse engineering of a Microsoft Optical Mouse (Model: X01-03410-02) to harvest high-quality components for future robotics and AI-powered computer vision projects.The goal is to move beyond "black box" consumer electronics and understand the embedded systems that facilitate human-computer interaction.🛠 Hardware Analysis & Component Inventory1. The Optical Sensor (The "Brain")Identification: High-speed CMOS image sensor located at the center of the PCB.Function: Acts as a low-resolution camera that captures thousands of images per second to calculate displacement vectors (X and Y coordinates).Robotics Application: Planned use as an Optical Flow Sensor for autonomous navigation, allowing a robot to track its position relative to the floor without GPS.2. Micro-Switches (Mechanical Inputs)Identification: Two primary tactile switches located under the Left/Right click triggers.Function: Standard "Normally Open" (NO) momentary switches.Robotics Application: These will be harvested and repurposed as Bumper/Collision Sensors. When the robot physicaly contacts an obstacle, these switches will trigger an interrupt in the control logic (Python/C++) to initiate obstacle avoidance.3. Rotary Encoder (The Scroll Wheel)Identification: Infrared (IR) emitter and receiver pair used with the scroll wheel.Robotics Application: Repurposing this as a Tachometer to measure wheel RPM, ensuring the robot maintains a constant velocity.4. USB Power InterfaceConfiguration: 4-wire shielded cable.Pinout Identified:Red: VCC (+5V)Black: GND (Ground)White: Data-Green: Data+Application: The cable remains attached to serve as a regulated 5V power probe, allowing the board to be powered directly from a laptop (HP EliteBook) or a standard 5V wall adapter for testing.📸 Teardown GalleryStage 1: The ShellStage 2: Internal PCBStage 3: Bare Metal🚀 Future Integration (Roadmap)This teardown is the first phase of a larger robotics initiative. The harvested parts will be integrated into the following systems:Chassis Powering: Utilizing an HP EliteBook 19.5V power supply stepped down for high-torque motors.Navigation: Implementing the Optical Sensor data into a Python-based navigation stack.AI Logic: Using PyTorch-based models to process environmental data, with these hardware components serving as the primary physical feedback loop.👨‍💻 About the AuthorJerryComputer Science Student | University of the PeopleAI Engineer & CTO | Prae TechnologiesInterests: AI Engineering, Embedded Systems, Product Design, and Robotics.Location: Lagos, Nigeria
